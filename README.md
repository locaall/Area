# Run
1) Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2) Download `TempleOS.ISO` file [here](https://templeos.org/)
3) Make new virtual machine with an optional name, possibly "**_TempleOS_**"
4) Type should be `Other` and version `Other/Unknown (64-bit)`
5) TempleOS requires at least `512MB RAM` and by default `2GB storage space`
6) Go into `Settings` -> `Display` -> Turn the `Video Memory` all the way up to `128MB`
7) On the first run, TempleOS will ask you some questions. Make sure after installing the OS you disconnect the ISO file

# HolyC
For understanding code, I recommend you search the documentation, or use websites such as [TinkerOS](tinkeros.github.io) which is a snapshot of Terry's old website.
You can join `r/TempleOS_Official` on Reddit and talk with other same-minded people who are there to help you! If you want to explore, make sure to explore the

# Include the program
On the creation of a virtual machine you can choose different types of storage. If you choose the .VHD file format, you can mount it as a partition in Windows via Disk Manager. See way #7 in this [article](https://whatsoftware.com/access-virtual-hard-disks-easily-in-windows-7/) for how. 

### Running on TempleOS

When you import the code, you can either: 
1) **Run it from the editor**
2) **Run it from the CMD**

#### Run it from the Editor


### Run it from the CMD
From the CMD, type `#include Area.HC.Z` and press `Enter`. You've just loaded the program into memory! Now type `Area;` to run it.

### Quit the program
Press `ESC` to stop it and `SHIFT + ESC` to close the program.
